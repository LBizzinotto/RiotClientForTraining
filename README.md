<h3>#01 - Riot's Web Client </h3>

<hr>

Welcome to my first project
<br>

It's a basic web page created just for training/improving my html/css skills and so I can start learning JavaScript. I'm feeding it regularly as I grow as a developer.

I have **no intention to violate** copyrights or anything. If I did that, please tell me and I'm sorry.

I just want to showcase my skills and look for a job as a junior developer.

Thank you so much, <br>
**Enjoy it!**
